# Tilt-Blinds
Problem: I am paraplegic.  I occupy a room in the basement with 2 side-byside windows for outside light.  I cannot reach the blind controls.  There is an electrical outlet nearby.

Solution ESP8266 nodemcu controls a stepper motor using a IR remote control.

everything is packaged in 2 small plastic project boxes.  The 28BYJ48 stepper motors are connected to the tilt rods via a epoxey putty coupler.  The 2 boxes are connected via a length of cat 5 cable using 1 pair to carry 6 volts, 1 pair to carry ground and the other wires to carry the signals.
